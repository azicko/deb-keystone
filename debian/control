Description: OpenStack identity service - library
 This is the identity service used by OpenStack for authentication (authN)
 and high-level authorization (authZ). It currently supports token-based
 authN and user-service authorization. It is scalable to include OAuth, SAML
 and openID in future versions. Out of the box, Keystone uses a SQLite DB as
 an identity store with the option to connect to external LDAP.
 .
 This package contains the Python libraries.
